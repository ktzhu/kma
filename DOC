Our implementation of the buddy system algorithm allocates buffers as a full page, and we have a global variable that we use to keep track how many pages are being used as well as how many allocs we have done. In addition, we implemented a list that keeps track of every block that is free, so whenever there is a request, we simply check that list. If there is a hit, we call `split` on our large buffer to get smaller ones (half the size of the large) until we find the correct size block. If there is a miss, create a new page and then split the buffer to find the appropriate-sized block. We implemented `coalesce` to combine buddy blocks.

The SVR4 lazy buddy algorithm is very similar to our implementation of the buddy system algorithm, though a significant change is that we now add free buffers to our free list in increasing address order of the buffer. In addition, we added a variable to our list struct that keeps track of the slack of every free list.
